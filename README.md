# Robotic_Vision
A repository to store programs associated with robotic vision

This repository contains three files that all form the Robotic Vision program. The code has been written for a raspberry Pi
combined with a PiBorg MonsterBorg Chassis. 
The motor driver in the chassis is a ThunderBorg. 
The three programs ad what they do are as follows:

maze_edge_detect.py - contains the edge detection 

maze_steering.py - contains the steering element

maze_image_processing - is the main file that calls the other two files and contains the driving element.

The scripts are not yet working as there is a bug that I am currently working on.
